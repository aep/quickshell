this is my bar for hyprland with quickshell.org
its mostly vibe coded, and just for me. i'm just sharing this for inspiration.

you could use it as a base for your own thing. clone to ~/.config/quickshell/something and call quickshell -c something

an out of the box solution would be something like https://github.com/end-4/dots-hyprland or https://github.com/caelestia-dots/shell
